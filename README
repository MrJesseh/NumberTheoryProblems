# Number Theory & Cryptography Problems in Different Programming Languages

This is just a repository I use to push different number theory problems to that I rewrite in different languages.
Originally, these are all meant to be done in maple, but I get bored and write them in other languages to compare them.

Feel free to use these however you wish, this is just something I mess around with.
